    <p> Before we get started make sure to use starcode "Seyi" when buying robux or premium it helps support me and my channel <br> <br> First we're gonna join Spotify Island and this game is also giving out another free UGC which is a cute flowery mini bagpack.  So all we have to do to get the boombox is to go to Spotify Park and go to the crystals, break them open and click the musical notes or push them and it gives you the badge. Let's check it out.</p>
